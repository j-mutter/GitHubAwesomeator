## GitHub Awesomeator

A cool Mac OS app and browser extension package to make using GitHub more awesome.

Currently, the app makes Pull Request checkouts a snap - simply click the download button that gets added to each PR page, and the app will find the repo on your system and check out the PR's branch.
